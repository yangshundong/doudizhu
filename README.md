 a small PC game  based on JAVA SE
 
 As a Java developer, I designed and developed a simple chess and card game based on the Java SE platform. The game uses the core functions of the Java language, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.
In this game, I used Java's graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit Swing to implement the graphical interface of the game. I also use the Java collection framework to manage data such as cards and players of the game, and use multi-threading technology to achieve concurrent processing and animation effects of the game.
Through this project, I deeply understood the core knowledge and technologies of the Java SE platform, and improved my programming ability and problem-solving ability. At the same time, this project also demonstrated my design and development capabilities, as well as my interest and enthusiasm for the field of game development.



The following is an example of the effect
